--- TO DISCUSS

  https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder (public BuilderExample build())
    - Strange syntax. How it works?
    - Related topic: how fields verifications works in the DTO? (If instancing happens but no fields assignment, why there is no error?)
  Issues on GitHub and Tasks and Context management in the IDE
  Difference between attribute and field
  EPAM learning courses (Java Basic)

--- BACKLOG

  - UNPRIORITIZED
  performing Code review
  Errors and Exceptions processing
  Adding viewports to every entity:
    - Order
    - Item
    - OrderItem
  Add active UI elements

  - PRIORITIZED
   To realize flow: new order with items -> reserve items (with checks) -> confirm order
   SQL

---- SPRINT

  TODO
    - Make an endpoint which returns all items and stored quantity (Will need: a new DTO, a new method in the service)
    - Make an endpoint which create order with required quantity of items. Should happens write off from the storehouse.
        If there is no enough of items should return error.
    - optional: fasten a Hibernate's logger, which logs requests. (Will need properties with formatting)

---- DONE

- 15.04.22
